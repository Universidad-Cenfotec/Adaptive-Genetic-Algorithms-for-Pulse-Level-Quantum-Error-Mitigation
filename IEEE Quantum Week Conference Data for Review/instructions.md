# IEEE Quantum Week 2025 - Data Review

## Overview
To enhance the transparency and efficiency of the review process, all experimental data for the *IEEE Quantum Week 2025* conference has been organized into algorithm-specific directories. Each algorithm has its own folder containing structured access to logs, summary results, and complete outputs, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of quantum algorithms under different noise conditions.

## Folder Structure

Each algorithm has its own folder structured as follows:

### 1. **Summary of Results**
Located within each algorithm's directory, this folder contains the **genetic evolution data** tested under three different noise levels:
- **High Noise**
- **Mid Noise**
- **Low Noise**

The results demonstrate how the genetic algorithm adapts to optimize quantum circuits under these varying noise conditions, highlighting convergence trends and fidelity improvements.

### 2. **Logs**
This directory, within each algorithm's folder, includes **execution logs**, which provide detailed insights into each iteration of the optimization process. The logs record:
- Algorithm configurations
- Fitness scores over generations
- Selected mutations and crossovers
- Final performance metrics

These logs serve as a valuable reference for tracking the step-by-step evolution of the optimization process.

### 3. **Full Output Circuit Information**
This folder, also within each algorithm's directory, contains the **detailed outputs of all experiments**, including:
- **Visualizations & Graphs**: Fidelity evolution plots, parameter distributions, and noise impact assessments.
- **Quantum Circuit Representations**: Optimized pulse sequences and gate configurations.
- **Statistical Analyses**: Comparative metrics across different runs.

This comprehensive dataset enables in-depth analysis and validation of the experimental findings.

## Purpose
By structuring the data in this manner, we aim to provide a clear, systematic, and reproducible approach to reviewing quantum algorithm performance under realistic noise conditions. This will assist researchers in evaluating the effectiveness of pulse-level genetic optimization techniques in mitigating quantum errors.
